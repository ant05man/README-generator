# Project Title
README-generator
## Description
This is a project where we had to create a function that creates a README file. This file has the components that you need inside a README file. We will be prompted to answer questions inside a js file and the README will be updated with that information when it is created. We created badges that pops up at the top of the page when the license is selected. When you click inside content of Table of Contents, you will be guiding to corresponding section on the page of what you clicked.
